It was fun, we learned a bunch from it and most importantly: From a pure forensics standpoint, the challenge was applicable to real life. So as a student enrolled in a Bachelor for IT Forensics &amp;amp; Cybercrime, that was really fun &amp;amp; motivating to see. So what challenge am I even talking about?</description></item><item><title>my-first-post</title><link>https://ashf0x.com/posts/my-first-post/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Nov 2021 12:29:41 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ashf0x.com/posts/my-first-post/</guid><description>Gamer R TL;DR Reverse a Unity game and patch it to get the flag
Description This challenge was the last Reversing challenge for TJCTF and gave 80 points. The challenge provided you with a folder that contained a binary as well as several Unity related files and libraries. The game itself was pretty simple. All you had to do was hit space to shoot a knife and hit an orange, all while trying to avoid hitting the ducks swimming randomly in between.</description></item></channel></rss>
